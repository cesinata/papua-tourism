An exceptional experience! There are lots of whale sharks, very large but careful to avoid you in the water, no risk of a head-on collision unless you come across a dazed individual ^^ it's really very impressive and we got some great videos (our guide was filming with a gopro). As for Kalilemon, it's a very pretty, very quiet place with kind, discreet owners. The food was delicious - I'm not a big fan of fish, but here I got my fill! Concerning adventure Indonesia, the organization was top-notch, with excellent pre-trip e-mail communication and help with questions that didn't concern their excursion. It was one of our favorite moments of our trip to Indonesia. Of course, it's not for everyone (for the complete package) but if you can afford it, don't hesitate!!!!",Pasangan,0,Ditulis pada 5 November 2023,positif,positif,netral,positif

After 10 minutes we stop at the first bagan and the fisherman said there was only one whale shark there and suggested us to go to the other bagan where more whale sharks could be find. It was true, at the 2nd bagan we met 3 whale sharks and swam there for about an hour. We pay Rp 300000,- to the fisherman as the compensation for them to feed the whale sharks with shrimps to keep the whale sharks stay around the bagan. It was really amazing to swim very close with those whale sharks.

After almost 2 days traveling from the Netherlands we finally set foot in Nabire. We asked for a taxi to take us to the Grand Papua hotel but they were full, after which we were taken to Wisma Kamusioh. As we arrived quite early, we stood at the closed door. On the main road through Nabire we saw Karya Papua hotel so we ended up there for the first day/night. Although the hotel had friendly staff and a proper restaurant, it was not clean at all. So we decided to spend our last 2 nights elsewhere. This being Wisma Kamusioh, they were present in the afternoon on that day. We recommend this guesthouse to everyone. The owner (Mellie) speaks English, the staff is friendly and the space is just right. This guesthouse was found on booking.com. Than on a whaleshark trip. Mellie at Kamusioh could organize the trip. By boat from Nabire, lunch included, the compensation for the fishermen in the first chart was the whalesharks were present and we could be asked to go to another chart if we liked. If we wanted to go to the second chart, we had to pay 100.000 - 300.000 by ourselves at the fishermen. Nothing is said about the park entrance, and according to Mellie this is not necessary. She asked 5 million rupiah for the whole trip for 2 people. Mellie's uncle transferred us to a boat on the beach in Nabire and his cousin was the boat captain. Don't expect western safety standards, there are no life vests or even oars on the boat, but it's all part of the adventure proper and most of the time you are close to shore. One negative point was that we saw one whale with fish lines attached. The fishermen were not too worried about this. Because during our presence it happened twice that the line was adrift on the whaleshark, but the guys just blocked the line until the line broke or the hook ripped off. It's not an encouraging sight as you actually see the stressful reaction of the whaleshark. But in the end what can we say? Mainly because of the fishermen on the chart we were all able to enjoy this wonderful experience. We will never forget Nabire and the whalesharks.",Pasangan,0,Ditulis pada 18 Oktober 2018,positif,positif,positif,positif

You should do at least once in a lifetime. there are a couple of places on this earth that you can encounter with these amazing creatures throughout the year. the ones I know are in oslob (philiphine), also derawan, borneo (Indonesia). oslob is too touristy and very popular, derawan last time my friend went there was not good in visibility. so Nabire is the perfect place, with clear water and a quiet place that you can enjoy yourself (actually I was the only tourist at that time). The best and yet cheapest way is to hire a local guide who can organize you everything from cars, boats, homestays, meals, and definitely to visit the charts and swim with the whales. But before you make a deal with the local guide, make sure that you set a deal that includes all the requirements such as gasoline (whether you go by boat or car), national park entrance fees, and fees to pay for puri fish (small fish for bait) to the fishermen at the chart. Also make it clear that the price is the entire package per day per group, not per person. After making an agreement with the suggested guide, we prefer to go to kwatisore by boat from Nabire beach, considering this is the fastest way that takes about 1 to 1 and a half hours. If by road, it takes 3 hours. We left at around 7.30am (30 minutes late but still tolerable). Reach the family homestay in kwatisore to drop off our luggage. Don't expect for a luxury homestay or hotel or resort, It's really a house owned by the family of our guide with basic facilities, but they catered and treated us like kings and queens that day. We went straight to hit the first chart (only took 15 - 20 minutes) after being served with hot tea and fried bananas. Tidak sabar untuk berenang bersama si kucing. Pertemuan pertama dengan 2 raksasa lembut yang dalam bahasa lokal disebut “Gurano Bintang”, gugup, bersemangat, gembira, dan senang dengan perasaan campur aduk. After about 90 minutes and my camera battery drained, we moved to the next chart and encountered another whaleshark. Same with the next 90 minutes my backup battery was also empty, so we decided to end the wonderful experience and promised to meet up the next morning. Back to the guest house for a big lunch, yuk we are starving after hours of swimming in the open sea. The food provided by our guide's family is so delicious, we end up with happy bellies. Did I mention earlier that the guest house is located right in front of the beach? Well, it is a beautiful beach with clear and very clean water. We spent time at the guest house swimming, playing with the friendly dog owned by the guest house, and sleeping in the hammock. And then, afternoon snacks were served with fresh coconut water that we drank directly from the coconut. Yeap, maybe not a luxury accommodation with basic amenities, but once again the service from the family was amazing. The next morning we were ready to get back on the chart and swim with our new giant friends. But we were unlucky that time, the wind was very strong and the waves were getting higher, there were no whalesharks at all around the chart. We decided to go back to the chart and wait for the sea to calm down. Once again, we were served with snacks and hot tea, while we swam on the beach in front of the guest house. Around noon after lunch, we tryng back to the bagan and still unlucky? with the same strong winds. Finally we decided to go back to the homestay to pack up and head back to Nabire. Not the best day though but still happy that it wasn't bad at all after yesterday's experience. Based on this, I would suggest spending an extra day just in case you don't encounter the Whalesharks so you can organize the next day until you do. Additional tips would be to check the weather, the moon calendar, and schedule in great detail considering it's not too cheap to get to this place. Good luck",Teman,0,Ditulis pada 17 April 2018,positif,positif,positif,positif

I had some concerns about the environmental impact of our tourist presence, but was reassured by Travel Papua's eco-friendly approach. We were there for 2 days and didn't see any other tourists. We stayed at the house of a local fisherman, who was also our captain. The bay itself is about a 3 hour drive from Nabire with the last hour being along a dirt road that seems impassable at times due to landslides. As I understand it, the sharks are habituated - they approach the large floating platform and try breaking nets to steal fish; over time local fishermen have been feeding them to try to divert them from the nets.We only saw one shark on the first day, but on the second day we spent a long time snorkeling with 5 of them. We tried our best not to touch the sharks, but they didn't seem afraid to whip us with their tails! As far as I can see, this is a small scale operation. Our skipper was very careful when approaching the platform and I saw no damage from the propeller to or on the shark. The only signs of human intervention were tracking tags on one or two of them. My personal opinion is that as long as tourist excursions continue to be handled responsibly and in the most environmentally friendly manner, then this is a wonderfully magical experience that a lucky few of us can hope to experience :)",,0,Ditulis pada 25 Maret 2018,positif,positif,positif,netral

The next day we called Merry Yoweni for an excursion to the whale sharks, she was in Jayapura, but Kris, her husband came to our hotel. He was very busy with all kinds of things but would arrange the excursion for us with local fishermen and the 4.5 million rupiah for this day mainly benefited the local people. The next morning we were picked up at 6:00 am by 2 men, Kris brought lunch later (he had overslept), a few white rolls, water and a jar of peanut butter. The 2 hour drive to the fishing village went via the local market where a huge amount of betel nuts were purchased, people spit and smoked cigarettes during the entire journey. At the fishing village the stock of betel nuts was first distributed and we went in a boat with a local fisherman to look for whale sharks. The fisherman was as stoned as a shrimp, but no one spoke a word of English, and after passing a number of bagans, fishing platforms, he called off the search. In consultation with Kris, he had indicated that the fishermen fed the whale sharks with small fish every day, and therefore the fishermen knew where the whale sharks came. Afterwards it turned out that the fisherman had not spent the 500,000 rupiah on buying the bait and the fishermen on the platform did not indicate where the whale sharks were. After we were dropped off on a small island, the fisherman went fishing himself and we were returned to the fishing village after just a few hours; any communication was not possible. In the evening Kris called and came to the hotel. He indicated that mistakes had been made and offered to refund the money for the bait, he also took us to the airport the next day. Kris is a very nice man full of good intentions, but the local people are not yet ready for tourism. After we flew to Biak the next day, we regretted it and returned to Nabire and booked 3 nights at Kali Lemon resort, this was first class, see separate report.",Pasangan,0,Ditulis pada 14 November 2016,negatif,positif,positif,positif

Maybe I was very unlucky and maybe the trip arranger didn't have experience to manage a failed trip and we felt very neglected. We went to Nabire after our trip to Raja Ampat, especially to see whale sharks. I and my husband spent around 500 USD to go there on a Batik Air plane with a bad connection (we had to fly back from Sorong to Ambon for 2 hours, transit 5 hours then flew another 2 hours to Nabire from Ambon). It was in a Thursday. After that we only have a day to do the whale shark trip because the next day (Sat) we needed to fly to Jakarta, and flight to Jakarta is not available by Sunday so if we don't take the one in Saturday we need to stay in Nabire until Monday. We arranged the trip with Merri Yoweni, which contact I saw via internet. Merri was in Jayapura so her sister Ellen help to arrange the trip. The cost per boat was 5.8 mio IDR and we shared it with another couple. I thought I need to book a hotel myself and then go to whale sharks place the next day with Merri's people but apparently in a conjuction with this trip we were ""obligated"" to stay in a hotel owned by Merri's family which is called Blue Moon Resort (or something with Moon) and the hotel price is not included in the package. the resort was quite far from the city center, around 30mins and quite remote. And we figured that staying there is only take us further to the whale shark place (we went on the next day to shale shark place from a beach next to the airport, and staying in the Moon  resort cost us around 1 hour back and forth to the beach). the hotel price was 400thou/night and we had to pay also for our food, which is quite expensive but we had no option since the location was remote. the hotel condition was simple and enough for staying but don't expect anything fancy. the next day we took bfast by 5.30Am as according to Ellen we need to go by 6AM. the day before Ellen told us that we needed to order our lunch from the hotel's restaurant so she can bring it to the boat, while according to Merri lunch should be included. So we noticed different arrangement between Ellen and Merri. The discussion was not settled but then despite of having said that we had to go by 6 Ellen was still cooking and we had to wait until 6.30AM before we went from the hotel. We arrived at Nabire beach, next to the airport, by 7AM. To our surprise the boat was still not ready. Merri insisted us to pay our down payment 3 days before the trip and I paid 2mio IDR from my 2.9mio bill, she said so that her ""management"" can arrange the boat. But Ellen only arranged the boat trip the night before, and the fishermen only started to pull the boat to the water, installing the machine and seats etc when we arrived there so we lost another half an hour and only took off from the beach by 7.30 AM. It took us around 1.5-2 hours to reach the bagans, basically sort of a floating raft where fisherman catch fishes. Whale sharks like to eat little fishes from the bagans and that's why we hunt them there. According to Merri whale shark foods were included in the price but we realized that we didn't bring any fishes when we took off and we asked this to the fisherman but the fisherman said confidently that it was already provided. We started to visit bagan over bagan until around 6 bagans but apparently no whale sharks. The fisherman started to get a bit nervous and they said we should go back to the first two bagans because the other bagans didn't have the little fishes that whale sharks like and the first two had them so their plan was to use those little fishes to invite the whale sharks to go up. Apparently what they meant that the whale sharks food already provided was actually they expected to find them in bagans, which apparently was not the case. We went back to the first 2 bagans but unfortunately they also didn't have the little fishes (they call it Puri fishes). without the little fishes the fisherman was powerless and we couldn't get the whale sharks to get to the surface. and after around 2 hours going around in a boat under the sun we had to give up and went back to the beach. What was very annoying about this failed trip is the weak management. The fisherman couldn't explain to us why the whale sharks didn't appear (we conclude ourselves that it was because of no Puri fishes) and in the end he said that usually guests have to bring their own Puri fishes (but at the beginning we already asked about the fishes and he said it would be provided!). We tried to call Merri and SMS her about the failed trip but she only replied by SMS saying that Ellen should take care of us and she was having a meeting. <br /><br />When we went back to the inn Ellen was not around and she finally showed up at night and we complained to her about the failed trip due to the non existence of the Puri fishes. She reacted by saying that she is responsible of the resort and not about the trip arrangement, because the arrangement is Merri's responsibility (but Merri directed us to her). And we were not happy to hear that and we said that they promised us to provide the Whale shark foods and it was not available so we wanted some money refund. Ellen said she will talk to Merri and will talk to us the next day by 7AM because we had to go to the airport by 8AM. And the next day Ellen was not there. She was gone. 2 people from the inn came to us with a bill for the hotel and food and I told them I didn't want to pay until I see Ellen because she promised to see us by 7AM. But they told me that Ellen is in police office to report the fisherman to the police. And they wanted to drag us too the police office as well. I think they had a good connection with the police and this can bring us to an unfortunate situation and we then chose to pay so that we won't get into trouble and miss our flight. I SMS Merri and ask what her ""management"" have to say about this and that we wanted a money refund and she replied to me by SMS threaten me that she will be back to Nabire and we can settle this in the police office and she called me an ""unklowledgeable Indonesian who shows stupidity"". while for the other guests she used the reason that ""the boat management is different with our management."" Overall what I'm saying is that meeting the whale sharks should be a great experience but it is not always a sure thing so better to provide more than one day so you can try again. And if you arrange the trip with Merri Yoweni you have to accept the flaws in management and if you have complains about the service you will be threatened to be dragged to a police office and might have to endure some rude words like I did.",Pasangan,0,Ditulis pada 10 April 2016,negatif,negatif,negatif,negatif

The attention and care from our hostess, Amelia, and Pack and all the other staff was amazing. From pick up in Nabire to drop off, including Filadelfia Homestay for our last night was fantastic. As soon as we arrived we were taken out to get introduced to the whale sharks, this is less than 5 minutes from the resort. Soon we got up close and friendly with 3 of them, January for over an hour. Every day we scuba dived and went up to January 2 with 5 sharks each time, as long as we wanted. We were told not to touch the sharks but no one told us about the whale sharks, they often brushed up to us or gently nuzzled us with their tail fins. The water is warm, about 30 degrees hood. And quite clearly, it has hundreds of photos and video clips. Kalilemon is basic, but we had a comfortable bed, private room and bathroom and excellent local food with good eating on the deck over the water. much better than a 5* resort dive, we had a small village, a few guides and boat people, up to 5 whale sharks at a time all to ourselves. Couldn't ask for more. While this hotel is not cheap but stay at Nabire Kalilemon, we couldn't put a price on seeing whale sharks. This is an experience of a lifetime that we have now and we have definitely ticked off our bucket list.
