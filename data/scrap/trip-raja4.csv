No entrance fee. No services really either. Pick a day with light winds or you'll regret it. Must cross huge expanse of open ocean with zero protection from swell and wind waves and can be a very rough and unpleasant crossing as it was the day we went.","","0","","Written May 30, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

No sé si el dinero que cobran, que no es poco, por entrar en esta Área de Conservación se emplea bien o mal, pero el algunos puntos se ven plásticos dejados por los visitantes. La visita fue en viernes, así que coincidí con varios cientos de turistas locales que abarrotaban la cima para hacerse la foto de rigor. Lo que hice fue marcharme y regresar a media tarde cuando ya casi había desaparecido el gentío. El baño que me dí en esas aguas a esas horas fue maravilloso.","","0","","Written June 5, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Già quando ci si avvicina in barca per entrare nella laguna interna si inizia ad apprezzare questa meraviglia della natura. Una volta entrati si prosegue lentamente per ovvi motivi e questo permette di immergersi in un ambiente lagunare fatto di grandi formazioni rocciose ricoperte di alberi che emergono dall'acqua verde smeraldo, uno scenario visibile in pochi altri luoghi al mondo (come Wayang). Questo scenario si appezza ancora di più da una terrazza panoramica posta ad una certa altezza facilmente raggiungibile attraverso una comoda scala. Va detto che lo scenario completo e maggiormente coinvolgente si può cogliere solo con una visione dall'alto (vedi foto). Con il mio drone ho avuto l’opportunità di filmare tutta la bellezza di Piaynemo e dell’arcipelago di Raja Ampat in generale, video che poi ho pubblicato sul mio canale Youtube.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/30/62/3a/un-angolo-di-piaynemo.jpg
