From the parking area we must climb a quite steep hill but still easy enough to climb. It is about 5-10 minutes to climb. From the top the view was really amazing. I could see the Sentani Lake and the hills that create a beautiful painting. Sunset behind the hills was really amazing. There was a cross on the top that could be a nice object for photograph.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/15/5a/4d/the-cross-at-the-top.jpg
